Can you fix this error when building grfx_tests?
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/grfx/grfx2/headers/gidx.hpp:6:10: 'idx2.hpp' file not found

I messed up this git merge. I want to merge branch org-submods into main - just replace main with org-submods. Forget any existing changes on main. Can you do that?

Is it possible to put target "grfx_tests" inside target "grfx"?
