Can you fix this error when building grfx_tests?
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/grfx/grfx2/headers/gidx.hpp:6:10: 'idx2.hpp' file not found

I messed up this git merge. I want to merge branch org-submods into main - just replace main with org-submods. Forget any existing changes on main. Can you do that?

Is it possible to put target "grfx_tests" inside target "grfx"?

Can you change CMakeLists.txt for the project "grfx" so that the target "gtest_main" is shown as a subfolder of the target/folder "gtest"?
We can't change anything in the submodule googletest.

Can I eliminate "gtest_main" from the project "grfx" and build target "grfx_tests" without it?

Can you set for FOLDER property of "gtest_main" to place it inside "gtest"?
