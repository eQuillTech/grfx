I want to add the submodule at https://github.com/eQuillTech/grfx to my repo. I am calling:
git submodule add https://github.com/eQuillTech/grfx grfx

It says:
fatal: A git directory for 'grfx' is found locally with remote(s):
  origin        https://github.com/SPAhrenTech/grfx
If you want to reuse this local git directory instead of cloning again from
  https://github.com/eQuillTech/grfx
use the '--force' option. If the local git directory is not the correct repo
or you are unsure what this means choose another name with the '--name' option.

Can you fix that?

When I run
git submodule add https://github.com/google/googletest.git googletest

It says
fatal: 'googletest' already exists in the index

Can you fix that?

git submodule add https://github.com/eQuillTech/tlbx.git tlbx
git submodule add https://github.com/eQuillTech/arr.git arr
git submodule add https://github.com/eQuillTech/weiss.git weiss

I am trying to build objective-C target TriCalc, which uses the C++ library TopoMesh. I see the error 
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/TopoMesh/arr/headers/arr1.hpp:29:12: No template named 'initializer_list' in namespace 'std'
I may need to change the language settings in CMakeLists.txt. Can you check that?

Can you fix these warnings/errors when compiling target TriCalc?
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/TopoMesh/TriCalc/TriCalc.mm:16:23: Receiver 'NSImage' is a forward class and corresponding @interface may not exist
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/TopoMesh/TriCalc/TriCalc.mm:17:30: Instance method '-CGImageForProposedRect:context:hints:' not found (return type defaults to 'id')
/Users/phil3/Documents/Development/TopoMesh/TriCalc/TriCalc.mm:17:13: Cannot initialize a variable of type 'CGImageRef' (aka 'CGImage *') with an rvalue of type 'id'

How I can tell CMake to build TriCalc using CoreGraphics.framework?

Can you fix this error when linking TriCalc?
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_OBJC_CLASS_$_NSImage", referenced from:
       in TriCalc.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)


How can I use CONFIGURE_DEPENDS to make CMake check the filesystem for changes in any submodules?

Can you simplify lines 27-41 of CMakeLists.txt?
